# 7. Environments 

## 7.1 Introduction 

The environment is the data structure that powers scoping. 

Domain specific languages: dplyr and ggplot2


## 7.2  Environment basics

Generally, an environment is similar to a named list, with four important exceptions: 

* Every name much be unique

* The names in an environment are not ordered

* An environment has a parent

* Environments are not copied when modified

### 7.2.1 Basics

To create an environment, use *rlang::env()*. It works like *list()*, taking a set of name-value pairs: 

```{r}
e1 <- env(
  a = FALSE, 
  b = "a", 
  c = 2.3, 
  d1 = 1:3,
)
```

The job of an environment is to associate, or bind, a set of names to a set of values. 


Environments can "caontain" themselves. 
```{r}
e1$d2 <- e1

# display the memory address of the environment
e1

# display more information 
env_print(e1)

# Get a character vector 
env_names(e1)
```

### 7.2.2 Important environments

**Two important environments**: 

* current environment, *current_env()* is the environment in which code is currently executing. 

* global environment, *global_env()* is our "workspace", it's where all interactive (i.e. outside of a function) computation takes place. 

```{r}
# to compare environment 
identical(global_env(), current_env())
```

### 7.2.3 Parents

Every environment has a **parent**, another environment.  The parent is what's used to implement lexical scoping: if a name is not found in an environment, then R will look in its parent (and so on). 

```{r}
# e2a is the parent of e2b
e2a <- env(d = 4, e = 5)
e2b <- env(e2a, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)

env_print(e2a)
env_print(e2b)

# find the parent of an environment 
env_parent(e2a)
env_parent(e2b)

```

Only one environment doesn't have a parent: the **empty** environment. 

```{r}
e2c <- env(empty_env(), d = 4, e = 5)
e2d <- env(e2c, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)

env_parent(e2c)
env_parent(e2d)
```


By default, *env_parents()* stops when it gets to the global environment. The ancestors of the global environment include every attached package. 
```{r}
# Override the default, see the attached packages
env_parents(e2b, last = empty_env())
```

### 7.2.4 Super assignment, <<- 

Regular assignment, <-, always creates a variable in the current environment. 

Super assignment, <<-, never creates a variable in the current environment, but instead modifies an existing variable found in a parent environment

```{r}
# Regular assignment
x <- 0

# create a function with super assignment <<- 
f <- function() {
  x <<- 1
}

# excute the function and print out x
f()
x


```
"If <<- doesn't find an existing variable, it will create one in the global environment. This is usually undesirable, because global variables introduce non-obvious dependencies between functions. <<- is most ofter used in conjustion with a function factory."


### 7.2.5 Getting and Setting 

We can get and set elements of an environment iwth $ and [[ in the same way as a list: 

```{r}
e3 <- env(x = 1, y = 2)

e3$x
e3$y
e3[["y"]]
```

If we wnat to use a default value if the binding doesn't exist, we can use the *default* argument. 
```{r}
env_get(e3, "xyz", default = NA)
```

Two ways to add binding to an environment: 

* env_poke()

* env_bind()

```{r}
env_poke(e3, "a", 100)

env_bind(e3, a = 10, b = 20)

env_names(e3)

# determine if an environment has a binding with env_has():
env_has(e3, "a")
env_has(e3, "zyz")

```

"NULL" vs unbind()

```{r}
e3$a <- NULL
env_has(e3, "a")

env_unbind(e3, "a")

env_has(e3, "a")
```


### 7.2.6 Advanced bindings

There are two more exotic variants of env_bind():

* *env_bind_lazy()* creates **delayed bindings**, which are evaluated the first time they are accessed. Behind the scenes, delayed bindings create promise, so behave in the same way as function argumments. 

The primary use of delayed bindings is in *autoload()*, which allows R packages to provide datasets that behave like they are loaded in memory, even though they're only loaded from disk when needed. 

```{r}
env_bind_lazy(current_env(), b = {Sys.sleep(1); 1})

system.time(print(b))

system.time(print(b))

```

*env_bind_active()*: creates **active bindings** which are re-computed every time they're accessed: 

```{r}
env_bind_active(current_env(), z1 = function(val) runif(1))

z1

z1
```
Active bindings are used to implement R6's active fields. 


### 7.2.7 Exercises

* (1) List three ways in which an environment differs from a list: (a) every name must be unique; (b) oder doesn't matter; (c) environments have parenets; (d) environments have reference semantics.  

* (2) create a loop environment
```{r}
e1 <- env(x = "loop")
e1$x <- e1 

env_print(e1)
```

* (3) 
```{r}
e1 <- env(a = "loop")
e2 <- env(b = "dedoop")

e1$a <- e2
e2$b <- e1

print(e1)

env_print(e1)
env_print(e2)

```


## 7.3 Recursing over environments 






# 17. Big picture

## 17.1 Introduction 

Metaprogramming. 





# 18. Expressions

## 18.1 Introduction 

Take the following code, which multiplies a variable x by 10 and saves the result to a new variable called y. It doesn’t work because we haven’t defined a variable called "something":

```{r}
y <- something * 10
```

It would be nice if we could capture the intent of the code without executing it. In other words, how can we separate our description of the action from the action itself?

One way is to use rlang::expr():

```{r}
# Seperate code description from the action 
z <- rlang::expr(y <- something * 10)
z

```

*expr()* returns an expression, an object that capture the structure of the code without evaluating it. 

We can evaluate an expression with base::eval(): 

```{r}
# Evaluate the expression
something <- 1:4
eval(z)
y
```

The focus of this chapter is the data structures that underlie expressions. Mastering this knowledge will allow you to inspect and modify captured code, and to generate code with code.


You’ll also need the rlang package to capture and compute on expressions, and the lobstr package to visualise them.

```{r}
library(rlang)
library(lobstr)
```

## 18.2 Abstract syntax trees 

Expressions are also called **abstract syntax trees** (ASTs) because the structure of code is hierarchical and can be naturally represented as a tree. Understanding this tree structure is crucial for inspecting and modifying expressions (i.e. metaprogramming).

```{r}
# making a very shallow tree
lobstr::ast(f(x, "y", 1))
```

Creating a tree with multiple levels

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("plots/tree_with_mult_levels.png")

lobstr::ast(f(g(1, 2), h(3, 4, i())))
```


### 18.2.2 Non-code components

They are abstract because they only capture important structural details of the code, not whitespace or comments:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(
  f(x, y)
)
```

### 18.2.3 Infix calls

Every call in R can be written in tree form because any call can be written in prefix form (Section 6.8.1). Take y <- x * 10 again: what are the functions that are being called? It is not as easy to spot as f(x, 1) because this expression contains two infix calls: <- and *. That means that these two lines of code are equivalent:

y <- x * 10
`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10))

```{r}
lobstr::ast(y <- x * 10)

```

There really is no difference between the ASTs, and if you generate an expression with prefix calls, R will still print it in infix form:
```{r}

expr(`<-`(y, `*`(x, 10)))
```

### 18.2.4 Exercises

```{r}
# 1. 
lobstr::ast(f(g(h( 1 + 2 + 3) * (x + y) * z)))


lobstr::ast(f(g(h(i(1, 2, 3)))))

lobstr::ast(f(1, g(2, h(3, i()))))

lobstr::ast(f(g(1, 2), h(3, i(4, 5))))
```

## 18.3 Expressions

An **expression** is any member of the set of base types created by parsing code: constant scalars, symbols, call objects, and pairlists. 

### 18.3.1 Constants

Scalar constants are the simplest component of the AST 





# 19. Quasiquotation

## 19.1 Introduction

One of the fundamental ideas makes *expr()* and *ast()* work: quotation.

Three pillars of tidy evaluation: quasiquotation, quosures, and data mask. 

## 19.2 Motivation 


# 20. Evaluation 

## 20.1 Introduction 

The user-facing inverse of quotation is unquotation: it gives the user the ability to selectively evaluate parts of an otherwise quoted argument. 

Tidy evaluation: quasiquotation, quosure, and data masks. 

## 20.2 Evaluation basics

The first argument, expr, is the object to evaluate. 

The second argument, env, gives the environment in which the expression should be evaluated. By default, this is the current environment. 

```{r}
library(rlang)
library(purrr)
# expr and default env
x <- 10

eval(expr = expr(x), envir = parent.frame())

y <- 2
eval(expr = expr(x + y), envir = parent.frame())

# override the envir
eval(expr = expr(x + y), envir = env(x = 1000))

# The first argument is evaluated, not quoted, which can lead to confusing results once if you use a custom enviroment and forget to manually quote: 
eval(print(x + 1), envir = env(x = 1000))

# vs this one 
eval(expr = expr(print(x + 1)), envir = env(x = 1000))

```

How to use tidy evaluation for wrapping functions

## 20.5.1 Quoting and unquoting

Example: resamples a dataset

```{r}
# define a function 
resample <- function(df, n) {
  idx <- sample(nrow(df), n, replace = TRUE)
  df[idx, , drop = FALSE]
}

# test
resample(df = cars, n = 4)
```
