"1","FIRST ACT
"
"1","
"
"1","
"
"1","SCENE
"
"1","
"
"1","
"
"1","Morning-room in Algernon's flat in Half-Moon Street.  The room is
"
"1","luxuriously and artistically furnished.  The sound of a piano is heard in
"
"1","the adjoining room.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has
"
"1","ceased, Algernon enters.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  I didn't think it polite to listen, sir.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I'm sorry for that, for your sake.  I don't play
"
"1","accurately--any one can play accurately--but I play with wonderful
"
"1","expression.  As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.  I
"
"1","keep science for Life.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Yes, sir.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the
"
"1","cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Hands them on a salver.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.]  Oh! . . .
"
"1","by the way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when
"
"1","Lord Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of
"
"1","champagne are entered as having been consumed.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Why is it that at a bachelor's establishment the servants
"
"1","invariably drink the champagne?  I ask merely for information.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.  I have
"
"1","often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a
"
"1","first-rate brand.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Good heavens!  Is marriage so demoralising as that?
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  I believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir.  I have had very
"
"1","little experience of it myself up to the present.  I have only been
"
"1","married once.  That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between
"
"1","myself and a young person.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Languidly_._]  I don't know that I am much interested in your
"
"1","family life, Lane.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject.  I never think of
"
"1","it myself.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Very natural, I am sure.  That will do, Lane, thank you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Thank you, sir.  [Lane goes out.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Lane's views on marriage seem somewhat lax.  Really, if the
"
"1","lower orders don't set us a good example, what on earth is the use of
"
"1","them?  They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral
"
"1","responsibility.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Lane.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Mr. Ernest Worthing.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Jack.]
"
"1","
"
"1","[Lane goes out_._]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  How are you, my dear Ernest?  What brings you up to town?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, pleasure, pleasure!  What else should bring one anywhere?
"
"1","Eating as usual, I see, Algy!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Stiffly_._]  I believe it is customary in good society to
"
"1","take some slight refreshment at five o'clock.  Where have you been since
"
"1","last Thursday?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Sitting down on the sofa.]  In the country.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  What on earth do you do there?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Pulling off his gloves_._]  When one is in town one amuses
"
"1","oneself.  When one is in the country one amuses other people.  It is
"
"1","excessively boring.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  And who are the people you amuse?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Airily_._]  Oh, neighbours, neighbours.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Perfectly horrid!  Never speak to one of them.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  How immensely you must amuse them!  [Goes over and takes
"
"1","sandwich.]  By the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Eh?  Shropshire?  Yes, of course.  Hallo!  Why all these cups?  Why
"
"1","cucumber sandwiches?  Why such reckless extravagance in one so young?  Who
"
"1","is coming to tea?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  How perfectly delightful!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won't
"
"1","quite approve of your being here.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  May I ask why?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly
"
"1","disgraceful.  It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I am in love with Gwendolen.  I have come up to town expressly to
"
"1","propose to her.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that
"
"1","business.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  How utterly unromantic you are!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I really don't see anything romantic in proposing.  It is very
"
"1","romantic to be in love.  But there is nothing romantic about a definite
"
"1","proposal.  Why, one may be accepted.  One usually is, I believe.  Then
"
"1","the excitement is all over.  The very essence of romance is uncertainty.
"
"1","If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I have no doubt about that, dear Algy.  The Divorce Court was
"
"1","specially invented for people whose memories are so curiously
"
"1","constituted.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject.  Divorces are
"
"1","made in Heaven--[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich.  Algernon at
"
"1","once interferes.]  Please don't touch the cucumber sandwiches.  They are
"
"1","ordered specially for Aunt Augusta.  [Takes one and eats it.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, you have been eating them all the time.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  That is quite a different matter.  She is my aunt.  [Takes
"
"1","plate from below.]  Have some bread and butter.  The bread and butter is
"
"1","for Gwendolen.  Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Advancing to table and helping himself.]  And very good bread and
"
"1","butter it is too.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to
"
"1","eat it all.  You behave as if you were married to her already.  You are
"
"1","not married to her already, and I don't think you ever will be.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Why on earth do you say that?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt
"
"1","with.  Girls don't think it right.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, that is nonsense!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  It isn't.  It is a great truth.  It accounts for the
"
"1","extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place.  In
"
"1","the second place, I don't give my consent.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Your consent!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin.  And before I
"
"1","allow you to marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of
"
"1","Cecily.  [Rings bell.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Cecily!  What on earth do you mean?  What do you mean, Algy, by
"
"1","Cecily!  I don't know any one of the name of Cecily.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Lane.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-
"
"1","room the last time he dined here.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Lane goes out.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?  I
"
"1","wish to goodness you had let me know.  I have been writing frantic
"
"1","letters to Scotland Yard about it.  I was very nearly offering a large
"
"1","reward.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, I wish you would offer one.  I happen to be more than
"
"1","usually hard up.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is
"
"1","found.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver.  Algernon takes it at
"
"1","once.  Lane goes out.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say.  [Opens
"
"1","case and examines it.]  However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look
"
"1","at the inscription inside, I find that the thing isn't yours after all.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Of course it's mine.  [Moving to him.]  You have seen me with it a
"
"1","hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written
"
"1","inside.  It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette
"
"1","case.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one
"
"1","should read and what one shouldn't.  More than half of modern culture
"
"1","depends on what one shouldn't read.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I am quite aware of the fact, and I don't propose to discuss
"
"1","modern culture.  It isn't the sort of thing one should talk of in
"
"1","private.  I simply want my cigarette case back.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes; but this isn't your cigarette case.  This cigarette case
"
"1","is a present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn't
"
"1","know any one of that name.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Your aunt!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Yes.  Charming old lady she is, too.  Lives at Tunbridge Wells.
"
"1","Just give it back to me, Algy.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Retreating to back of sofa.]  But why does she call herself
"
"1","little Cecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells?
"
"1","[Reading.]  'From little Cecily with her fondest love.'
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.]  My dear fellow, what on
"
"1","earth is there in that?  Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.
"
"1","That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for
"
"1","herself.  You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your
"
"1","aunt!  That is absurd!  For Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case.
"
"1","[Follows Algernon round the room.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes.  But why does your aunt call you her uncle?  'From little
"
"1","Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.'  There is no
"
"1","objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no
"
"1","matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I
"
"1","can't quite make out.  Besides, your name isn't Jack at all; it is
"
"1","Ernest.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  It isn't Ernest; it's Jack.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  You have always told me it was Ernest.  I have introduced you
"
"1","to every one as Ernest.  You answer to the name of Ernest.  You look as
"
"1","if your name was Ernest.  You are the most earnest-looking person I ever
"
"1","saw in my life.  It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn't
"
"1","Ernest.  It's on your cards.  Here is one of them.  [Taking it from
"
"1","case.]  'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.'  I'll keep this as a
"
"1","proof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or
"
"1","to Gwendolen, or to any one else.  [Puts the card in his pocket.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the
"
"1","cigarette case was given to me in the country.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small
"
"1","Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle.
"
"1","Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.  It is
"
"1","very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn't a dentist.  It produces
"
"1","a false impression.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, that is exactly what dentists always do.  Now, go on!
"
"1","Tell me the whole thing.  I may mention that I have always suspected you
"
"1","of being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it
"
"1","now.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I'll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression
"
"1","as soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town
"
"1","and Jack in the country.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, produce my cigarette case first.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Here it is.  [Hands cigarette case.]  Now produce your
"
"1","explanation, and pray make it improbable.  [Sits on sofa.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation
"
"1","at all.  In fact it's perfectly ordinary.  Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who
"
"1","adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his
"
"1","grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew.  Cecily, who addresses me as her
"
"1","uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,
"
"1","lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable
"
"1","governess, Miss Prism.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Where is that place in the country, by the way?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  That is nothing to you, dear boy.  You are not going to be invited
"
"1",". . . I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I suspected that, my dear fellow!  I have Bunburyed all over
"
"1","Shropshire on two separate occasions.  Now, go on.  Why are you Ernest in
"
"1","town and Jack in the country?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  My dear Algy, I don't know whether you will be able to understand
"
"1","my real motives.  You are hardly serious enough.  When one is placed in
"
"1","the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all
"
"1","subjects.  It's one's duty to do so.  And as a high moral tone can hardly
"
"1","be said to conduce very much to either one's health or one's happiness,
"
"1","in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger
"
"1","brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the
"
"1","most dreadful scrapes.  That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and
"
"1","simple.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  The truth is rarely pure and never simple.  Modern life would
"
"1","be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete
"
"1","impossibility!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  That wouldn't be at all a bad thing.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.  Don't
"
"1","try it.  You should leave that to people who haven't been at a
"
"1","University.  They do it so well in the daily papers.  What you really are
"
"1","is a Bunburyist.  I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist.  You
"
"1","are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  What on earth do you mean?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest,
"
"1","in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.  I
"
"1","have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order
"
"1","that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.  Bunbury
"
"1","is perfectly invaluable.  If it wasn't for Bunbury's extraordinary bad
"
"1","health, for instance, I wouldn't be able to dine with you at Willis's to-
"
"1","night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a
"
"1","week.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I haven't asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I know.  You are absurdly careless about sending out
"
"1","invitations.  It is very foolish of you.  Nothing annoys people so much
"
"1","as not receiving invitations.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I haven't the smallest intention of doing anything of the
"
"1","kind.  To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite
"
"1","enough to dine with one's own relations.  In the second place, whenever I
"
"1","do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent
"
"1","down with either no woman at all, or two.  In the third place, I know
"
"1","perfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night.  She will place
"
"1","me next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the
"
"1","dinner-table.  That is not very pleasant.  Indeed, it is not even decent
"
"1",". . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.  The amount
"
"1","of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly
"
"1","scandalous.  It looks so bad.  It is simply washing one's clean linen in
"
"1","public.  Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I
"
"1","naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.  I want to tell you the
"
"1","rules.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I'm not a Bunburyist at all.  If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going
"
"1","to kill my brother, indeed I think I'll kill him in any case.  Cecily is
"
"1","a little too much interested in him.  It is rather a bore.  So I am going
"
"1","to get rid of Ernest.  And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr.
"
"1",". . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever
"
"1","get married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very
"
"1","glad to know Bunbury.  A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a
"
"1","very tedious time of it.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  That is nonsense.  If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and
"
"1","she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I
"
"1","certainly won't want to know Bunbury.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Then your wife will.  You don't seem to realise, that in
"
"1","married life three is company and two is none.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Sententiously.]  That, my dear young friend, is the theory that
"
"1","the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the
"
"1","time.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  For heaven's sake, don't try to be cynical.  It's perfectly easy
"
"1","to be cynical.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  My dear fellow, it isn't easy to be anything nowadays.  There's
"
"1","such a lot of beastly competition about.  [The sound of an electric bell
"
"1","is heard.]  Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta.  Only relatives, or creditors,
"
"1","ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.  Now, if I get her out of the way for
"
"1","ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to
"
"1","Gwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis's?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I suppose so, if you want to.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes, but you must be serious about it.  I hate people who are
"
"1","not serious about meals.  It is so shallow of them.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Lane.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Algernon goes forward to meet them.  Enter Lady Bracknell and
"
"1","Gwendolen.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving
"
"1","very well.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  That's not quite the same thing.  In fact the two things
"
"1","rarely go together.  [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [To Gwendolen.]  Dear me, you are smart!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I am always smart!  Am I not, Mr. Worthing?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  You're quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Oh! I hope I am not that.  It would leave no room for
"
"1","developments, and I intend to develop in many directions.  [Gwendolen and
"
"1","Jack sit down together in the corner.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  I'm sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was
"
"1","obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury.  I hadn't been there since her poor
"
"1","husband's death.  I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty
"
"1","years younger.  And now I'll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice
"
"1","cucumber sandwiches you promised me.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Certainly, Aunt Augusta.  [Goes over to tea-table.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Won't you come and sit here, Gwendolen?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Thanks, mamma, I'm quite comfortable where I am.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Picking up empty plate in horror.]  Good heavens!  Lane!  Why
"
"1","are there no cucumber sandwiches?  I ordered them specially.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  [Gravely.]  There were no cucumbers in the market this morning,
"
"1","sir.  I went down twice.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  No cucumbers!
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  No, sir.  Not even for ready money.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  That will do, Lane, thank you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Thank you, sir.  [Goes out.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no
"
"1","cucumbers, not even for ready money.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  It really makes no matter, Algernon.  I had some
"
"1","crumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for
"
"1","pleasure now.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  It certainly has changed its colour.  From what cause I,
"
"1","of course, cannot say.  [Algernon crosses and hands tea.]  Thank you.
"
"1","I've quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon.  I am going to send you
"
"1","down with Mary Farquhar.  She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to
"
"1","her husband.  It's delightful to watch them.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the
"
"1","pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Frowning.]  I hope not, Algernon.  It would put my
"
"1","table completely out.  Your uncle would have to dine upstairs.
"
"1","Fortunately he is accustomed to that.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible
"
"1","disappointment to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say
"
"1","that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.  [Exchanges glances with
"
"1","Jack.]  They seem to think I should be with him.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  It is very strange.  This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer
"
"1","from curiously bad health.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time
"
"1","that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.
"
"1","This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.  Nor do I in any way
"
"1","approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.  I consider it morbid.
"
"1","Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.  Health
"
"1","is the primary duty of life.  I am always telling that to your poor
"
"1","uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any
"
"1","improvement in his ailment goes.  I should be much obliged if you would
"
"1","ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on
"
"1","Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.  It is my last
"
"1","reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation,
"
"1","particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said
"
"1","whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious,
"
"1","and I think I can promise you he'll be all right by Saturday.  Of course
"
"1","the music is a great difficulty.  You see, if one plays good music,
"
"1","people don't listen, and if one plays bad music people don't talk.  But
"
"1","I'll run over the programme I've drawn out, if you will kindly come into
"
"1","the next room for a moment.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Thank you, Algernon.  It is very thoughtful of you.
"
"1","[Rising, and following Algernon.]  I'm sure the programme will be
"
"1","delightful, after a few expurgations.  French songs I cannot possibly
"
"1","allow.  People always seem to think that they are improper, and either
"
"1","look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.  But German
"
"1","sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so.
"
"1","Gwendolen, you will accompany me.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Certainly, mamma.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains
"
"1","behind.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Pray don't talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing.
"
"1","Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain
"
"1","that they mean something else.  And that makes me so nervous.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I do mean something else.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I thought so.  In fact, I am never wrong.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady
"
"1","Bracknell's temporary absence . . .
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I would certainly advise you to do so.  Mamma has a way of
"
"1","coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her
"
"1","about.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Nervously.]  Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired
"
"1","you more than any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.  And I often wish
"
"1","that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.  For me you
"
"1","have always had an irresistible fascination.  Even before I met you I was
"
"1","far from indifferent to you.  [Jack looks at her in amazement.]  We live,
"
"1","as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals.  The fact is
"
"1","constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has
"
"1","reached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been
"
"1","to love some one of the name of Ernest.  There is something in that name
"
"1","that inspires absolute confidence.  The moment Algernon first mentioned
"
"1","to me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love
"
"1","you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  You really love me, Gwendolen?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Passionately!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Darling!  You don't know how happy you've made me.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  My own Ernest!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  But you don't really mean to say that you couldn't love me if my
"
"1","name wasn't Ernest?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  But your name is Ernest.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Yes, I know it is.  But supposing it was something else?  Do you
"
"1","mean to say you couldn't love me then?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Glibly.]  Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation,
"
"1","and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all
"
"1","to the actual facts of real life, as we know them.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don't much care
"
"1","about the name of Ernest . . . I don't think the name suits me at all.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  It suits you perfectly.  It is a divine name.  It has a music
"
"1","of its own.  It produces vibrations.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of
"
"1","other much nicer names.  I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack,
"
"1","if any at all, indeed.  It does not thrill.  It produces absolutely no
"
"1","vibrations . . . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without
"
"1","exception, were more than usually plain.  Besides, Jack is a notorious
"
"1","domesticity for John!  And I pity any woman who is married to a man
"
"1","called John.  She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing
"
"1","pleasure of a single moment's solitude.  The only really safe name is
"
"1","Ernest.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Gwendolen, I must get christened at once--I mean we must get
"
"1","married at once.  There is no time to be lost.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Married, Mr. Worthing?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Astounded.]  Well . . . surely.  You know that I love you, and
"
"1","you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely
"
"1","indifferent to me.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I adore you.  But you haven't proposed to me yet.  Nothing
"
"1","has been said at all about marriage.  The subject has not even been
"
"1","touched on.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well . . . may I propose to you now?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I think it would be an admirable opportunity.  And to spare
"
"1","you any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to
"
"1","tell you quite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept
"
"1","you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Gwendolen!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  You know what I have got to say to you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Yes, but you don't say it.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Gwendolen, will you marry me?  [Goes on his knees.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Of course I will, darling.  How long you have been about it!
"
"1","I am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Yes, but men often propose for practice.  I know my brother
"
"1","Gerald does.  All my girl-friends tell me so.  What wonderfully blue eyes
"
"1","you have, Ernest!  They are quite, quite, blue.  I hope you will always
"
"1","look at me just like that, especially when there are other people
"
"1","present.  [Enter Lady Bracknell.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Mr. Worthing!  Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent
"
"1","posture.  It is most indecorous.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Mamma!  [He tries to rise; she restrains him.]  I must beg
"
"1","you to retire.  This is no place for you.  Besides, Mr. Worthing has not
"
"1","quite finished yet.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Finished what, may I ask?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.  [They rise together.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.  When you do
"
"1","become engaged to some one, I, or your father, should his health permit
"
"1","him, will inform you of the fact.  An engagement should come on a young
"
"1","girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.  It is
"
"1","hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . .
"
"1","And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing.  While I am
"
"1","making these inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the
"
"1","carriage.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Reproachfully.]  Mamma!
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  In the carriage, Gwendolen!  [Gwendolen goes to the
"
"1","door.  She and Jack blow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell's
"
"1","back.  Lady Bracknell looks vaguely about as if she could not understand
"
"1","what the noise was.  Finally turns round.]  Gwendolen, the carriage!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Yes, mamma.  [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Sitting down.]  You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Pencil and note-book in hand.]  I feel bound to tell
"
"1","you that you are not down on my list of eligible young men, although I
"
"1","have the same list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.  We work together,
"
"1","in fact.  However, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your
"
"1","answers be what a really affectionate mother requires.  Do you smoke?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  I am glad to hear it.  A man should always have an
"
"1","occupation of some kind.  There are far too many idle men in London as it
"
"1","is.  How old are you?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Twenty-nine.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  A very good age to be married at.  I have always been of
"
"1","opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either
"
"1","everything or nothing.  Which do you know?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [After some hesitation.]  I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  I am pleased to hear it.  I do not approve of anything
"
"1","that tampers with natural ignorance.  Ignorance is like a delicate exotic
"
"1","fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.  The whole theory of modern
"
"1","education is radically unsound.  Fortunately in England, at any rate,
"
"1","education produces no effect whatsoever.  If it did, it would prove a
"
"1","serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of
"
"1","violence in Grosvenor Square.  What is your income?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Between seven and eight thousand a year.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Makes a note in her book.]  In land, or in investments?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  In investments, chiefly.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  That is satisfactory.  What between the duties expected
"
"1","of one during one's lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one's
"
"1","death, land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.  It gives one
"
"1","position, and prevents one from keeping it up.  That's all that can be
"
"1","said about land.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it,
"
"1","about fifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don't depend on that for my
"
"1","real income.  In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the
"
"1","only people who make anything out of it.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  A country house!  How many bedrooms?  Well, that point
"
"1","can be cleared up afterwards.  You have a town house, I hope?  A girl
"
"1","with a simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected
"
"1","to reside in the country.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year
"
"1","to Lady Bloxham.  Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six
"
"1","months' notice.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Lady Bloxham?  I don't know her.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, she goes about very little.  She is a lady considerably
"
"1","advanced in years.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of
"
"1","character.  What number in Belgrave Square?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  149.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Shaking her head.]  The unfashionable side.  I thought
"
"1","there was something.  However, that could easily be altered.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Do you mean the fashion, or the side?
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Sternly.]  Both, if necessary, I presume.  What are
"
"1","your politics?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, I am afraid I really have none.  I am a Liberal Unionist.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Oh, they count as Tories.  They dine with us.  Or come
"
"1","in the evening, at any rate.  Now to minor matters.  Are your parents
"
"1","living?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I have lost both my parents.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a
"
"1","misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.  Who was your father?
"
"1","He was evidently a man of some wealth.  Was he born in what the Radical
"
"1","papers call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the
"
"1","aristocracy?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I am afraid I really don't know.  The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I
"
"1","said I had lost my parents.  It would be nearer the truth to say that my
"
"1","parents seem to have lost me . . . I don't actually know who I am by
"
"1","birth.  I was . . . well, I was found.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Found!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable
"
"1","and kindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing,
"
"1","because he happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his
"
"1","pocket at the time.  Worthing is a place in Sussex.  It is a seaside
"
"1","resort.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class
"
"1","ticket for this seaside resort find you?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Gravely.]  In a hand-bag.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  A hand-bag?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Very seriously.]  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I was in a hand-bag--a
"
"1","somewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it--an ordinary
"
"1","hand-bag in fact.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew
"
"1","come across this ordinary hand-bag?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.  It was given to him in
"
"1","mistake for his own.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  The cloak-room at Victoria Station?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Yes.  The Brighton line.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  The line is immaterial.  Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel
"
"1","somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me.  To be born, or at any
"
"1","rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to
"
"1","display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds
"
"1","one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.  And I presume you
"
"1","know what that unfortunate movement led to?  As for the particular
"
"1","locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway
"
"1","station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion--has probably,
"
"1","indeed, been used for that purpose before now--but it could hardly be
"
"1","regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good society.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?  I need hardly
"
"1","say I would do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen's happiness.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and
"
"1","acquire some relations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort
"
"1","to produce at any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is
"
"1","quite over.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, I don't see how I could possibly manage to do that.  I can
"
"1","produce the hand-bag at any moment.  It is in my dressing-room at home.  I
"
"1","really think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Me, sir!  What has it to do with me?  You can hardly
"
"1","imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only
"
"1","daughter--a girl brought up with the utmost care--to marry into a cloak-
"
"1","room, and form an alliance with a parcel?  Good morning, Mr. Worthing!
"
"1","
"
"1","[Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Good morning!  [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the
"
"1","Wedding March.  Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.]  For
"
"1","goodness' sake don't play that ghastly tune, Algy.  How idiotic you are!
"
"1","
"
"1","[The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Didn't it go off all right, old boy?  You don't mean to say
"
"1","Gwendolen refused you?  I know it is a way she has.  She is always
"
"1","refusing people.  I think it is most ill-natured of her.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet.  As far as she is
"
"1","concerned, we are engaged.  Her mother is perfectly unbearable.  Never
"
"1","met such a Gorgon . . . I don't really know what a Gorgon is like, but I
"
"1","am quite sure that Lady Bracknell is one.  In any case, she is a monster,
"
"1","without being a myth, which is rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon,
"
"1","Algy, I suppose I shouldn't talk about your own aunt in that way before
"
"1","you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  My dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused.  It is the
"
"1","only thing that makes me put up with them at all.  Relations are simply a
"
"1","tedious pack of people, who haven't got the remotest knowledge of how to
"
"1","live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, that is nonsense!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  It isn't!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, I won't argue about the matter.  You always want to argue
"
"1","about things.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  That is exactly what things were originally made for.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Upon my word, if I thought that, I'd shoot myself . . . [A pause.]
"
"1","You don't think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother
"
"1","in about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  All women become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.
"
"1","No man does.  That's his.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Is that clever?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  It is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation
"
"1","in civilised life should be.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I am sick to death of cleverness.  Everybody is clever nowadays.
"
"1","You can't go anywhere without meeting clever people.  The thing has
"
"1","become an absolute public nuisance.  I wish to goodness we had a few
"
"1","fools left.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  We have.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I should extremely like to meet them.  What do they talk about?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  The fools?  Oh! about the clever people, of course.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  What fools!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being
"
"1","Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [In a very patronising manner.]  My dear fellow, the truth isn't
"
"1","quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.  What
"
"1","extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if
"
"1","she is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, that is nonsense.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  What about your brother?  What about the profligate Ernest?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him.  I'll
"
"1","say he died in Paris of apoplexy.  Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite
"
"1","suddenly, don't they?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes, but it's hereditary, my dear fellow.  It's a sort of
"
"1","thing that runs in families.  You had much better say a severe chill.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  You are sure a severe chill isn't hereditary, or anything of that
"
"1","kind?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Of course it isn't!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Very well, then.  My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly,
"
"1","in Paris, by a severe chill.  That gets rid of him.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  But I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too
"
"1","much interested in your poor brother Ernest?  Won't she feel his loss a
"
"1","good deal?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, that is all right.  Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am
"
"1","glad to say.  She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays
"
"1","no attention at all to her lessons.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I would rather like to see Cecily.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I will take very good care you never do.  She is excessively
"
"1","pretty, and she is only just eighteen.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively
"
"1","pretty ward who is only just eighteen?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh! one doesn't blurt these things out to people.  Cecily and
"
"1","Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends.  I'll bet
"
"1","you anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be
"
"1","calling each other sister.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of
"
"1","other things first.  Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at
"
"1","Willis's, we really must go and dress.  Do you know it is nearly seven?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Irritably.]  Oh!  It always is nearly seven.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, I'm hungry.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I never knew you when you weren't . . .
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  What shall we do after dinner?  Go to a theatre?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh no!  I loathe listening.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, let us go to the Club?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, no!  I hate talking.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, no!  I can't bear looking at things.  It is so silly.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, what shall we do?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Nothing!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  It is awfully hard work doing nothing.  However, I don't mind
"
"1","hard work where there is no definite object of any kind.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Lane.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Miss Fairfax.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Gwendolen.  Lane goes out.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Gwendolen, upon my word!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Algy, kindly turn your back.  I have something very
"
"1","particular to say to Mr. Worthing.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Really, Gwendolen, I don't think I can allow this at all.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards
"
"1","life.  You are not quite old enough to do that.  [Algernon retires to the
"
"1","fireplace.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  My own darling!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Ernest, we may never be married.  From the expression on
"
"1","mamma's face I fear we never shall.  Few parents nowadays pay any regard
"
"1","to what their children say to them.  The old-fashioned respect for the
"
"1","young is fast dying out.  Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I
"
"1","lost at the age of three.  But although she may prevent us from becoming
"
"1","man and wife, and I may marry some one else, and marry often, nothing
"
"1","that she can possibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Dear Gwendolen!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  The story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma,
"
"1","with unpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my
"
"1","nature.  Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination.  The
"
"1","simplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to
"
"1","me.  Your town address at the Albany I have.  What is your address in the
"
"1","country?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  The Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Algernon, who has been carefully listening, smiles to himself, and
"
"1","writes the address on his shirt-cuff.  Then picks up the Railway Guide.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  There is a good postal service, I suppose?  It may be
"
"1","necessary to do something desperate.  That of course will require serious
"
"1","consideration.  I will communicate with you daily.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  My own one!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  How long do you remain in town?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Till Monday.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Good!  Algy, you may turn round now.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Thanks, I've turned round already.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  You may also ring the bell.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  You will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Certainly.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [To Lane, who now enters.]  I will see Miss Fairfax out.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Jack and Gwendolen go off.]
"
"1","
"
"1","[Lane presents several letters on a salver to Algernon.  It is to be
"
"1","surmised that they are bills, as Algernon, after looking at the
"
"1","envelopes, tears them up.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  A glass of sherry, Lane.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Yes, sir.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  To-morrow, Lane, I'm going Bunburying.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Yes, sir.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I shall probably not be back till Monday.  You can put up my
"
"1","dress clothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits . . .
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Handing sherry.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  It never is, sir.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Lane, you're a perfect pessimist.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lane.  I do my best to give satisfaction, sir.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Jack.  Lane goes off.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  There's a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever cared
"
"1","for in my life.  [Algernon is laughing immoderately.]  What on earth are
"
"1","you so amused at?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Oh, I'm a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that is all.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  If you don't take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into a
"
"1","serious scrape some day.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I love scrapes.  They are the only things that are never
"
"1","serious.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, that's nonsense, Algy.  You never talk anything but nonsense.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Nobody ever does.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Jack looks indignantly at him, and leaves the room.  Algernon lights a
"
"1","cigarette, reads his shirt-cuff, and smiles.]
"

"
"1","
"
"1","
"
"1","
"
"1","
"
"1","SECOND ACT
"
"1","
"
"1","
"
"1","SCENE
"
"1","
"
"1","
"
"1","Garden at the Manor House.  A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the
"
"1","house.  The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses.  Time of year,
"
"1","July.  Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a
"
"1","large yew-tree.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Miss Prism discovered seated at the table.  Cecily is at the back
"
"1","watering flowers.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Calling.]  Cecily, Cecily!  Surely such a utilitarian
"
"1","occupation as the watering of flowers is rather Moulton's duty than
"
"1","yours?  Especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you.
"
"1","Your German grammar is on the table.  Pray open it at page fifteen.  We
"
"1","will repeat yesterday's lesson.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Coming over very slowly.]  But I don't like German.  It isn't
"
"1","at all a becoming language.  I know perfectly well that I look quite
"
"1","plain after my German lesson.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should
"
"1","improve yourself in every way.  He laid particular stress on your German,
"
"1","as he was leaving for town yesterday.  Indeed, he always lays stress on
"
"1","your German when he is leaving for town.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious!  Sometimes he is so serious
"
"1","that I think he cannot be quite well.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Drawing herself up.]  Your guardian enjoys the best of
"
"1","health, and his gravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one
"
"1","so comparatively young as he is.  I know no one who has a higher sense of
"
"1","duty and responsibility.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we
"
"1","three are together.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Cecily!  I am surprised at you.  Mr. Worthing has many
"
"1","troubles in his life.  Idle merriment and triviality would be out of
"
"1","place in his conversation.  You must remember his constant anxiety about
"
"1","that unfortunate young man his brother.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his
"
"1","brother, to come down here sometimes.  We might have a good influence
"
"1","over him, Miss Prism.  I am sure you certainly would.  You know German,
"
"1","and geology, and things of that kind influence a man very much.  [Cecily
"
"1","begins to write in her diary.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Shaking her head.]  I do not think that even I could
"
"1","produce any effect on a character that according to his own brother's
"
"1","admission is irretrievably weak and vacillating.  Indeed I am not sure
"
"1","that I would desire to reclaim him.  I am not in favour of this modern
"
"1","mania for turning bad people into good people at a moment's notice.  As a
"
"1","man sows so let him reap.  You must put away your diary, Cecily.  I
"
"1","really don't see why you should keep a diary at all.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my
"
"1","life.  If I didn't write them down, I should probably forget all about
"
"1","them.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about
"
"1","with us.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never
"
"1","happened, and couldn't possibly have happened.  I believe that Memory is
"
"1","responsible for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily.
"
"1","I wrote one myself in earlier days.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Did you really, Miss Prism?  How wonderfully clever you are!  I
"
"1","hope it did not end happily?  I don't like novels that end happily.  They
"
"1","depress me so much.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily.  That is what
"
"1","Fiction means.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I suppose so.  But it seems very unfair.  And was your novel
"
"1","ever published?
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Alas! no.  The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned.
"
"1","[Cecily starts.]  I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid.  To
"
"1","your work, child, these speculations are profitless.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Smiling.]  But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the
"
"1","garden.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Rising and advancing.]  Dr. Chasuble!  This is indeed a
"
"1","pleasure.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Canon Chasuble.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  And how are we this morning?  Miss Prism, you are, I trust,
"
"1","well?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Miss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache.  I
"
"1","think it would do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the
"
"1","Park, Dr. Chasuble.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Cecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that
"
"1","you had a headache.  Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my
"
"1","German lesson, when the Rector came in.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  I hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh, I am afraid I am.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  That is strange.  Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism's
"
"1","pupil, I would hang upon her lips.  [Miss Prism glares.]  I spoke
"
"1","metaphorically.--My metaphor was drawn from bees.  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, I
"
"1","suppose, has not returned from town yet?
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  We do not expect him till Monday afternoon.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Ah yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London.  He is
"
"1","not one of those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that
"
"1","unfortunate young man his brother seems to be.  But I must not disturb
"
"1","Egeria and her pupil any longer.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Egeria?  My name is Laetitia, Doctor.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  [Bowing.]  A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan
"
"1","authors.  I shall see you both no doubt at Evensong?
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  I think, dear Doctor, I will have a stroll with you.  I find
"
"1","I have a headache after all, and a walk might do it good.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  With pleasure, Miss Prism, with pleasure.  We might go as far
"
"1","as the schools and back.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  That would be delightful.  Cecily, you will read your
"
"1","Political Economy in my absence.  The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee
"
"1","you may omit.  It is somewhat too sensational.  Even these metallic
"
"1","problems have their melodramatic side.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Goes down the garden with Dr. Chasuble.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Picks up books and throws them back on table.]  Horrid
"
"1","Political Economy!  Horrid Geography!  Horrid, horrid German!
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Mr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station.  He
"
"1","has brought his luggage with him.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Takes the card and reads it.]  'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The
"
"1","Albany, W.'  Uncle Jack's brother!  Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in
"
"1","town?
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  He seemed very much disappointed.  I mentioned
"
"1","that you and Miss Prism were in the garden.  He said he was anxious to
"
"1","speak to you privately for a moment.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here.  I suppose you had better
"
"1","talk to the housekeeper about a room for him.
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Yes, Miss.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Merriman goes off.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I have never met any really wicked person before.  I feel rather
"
"1","frightened.  I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.]  He does!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Raising his hat.]  You are my little cousin Cecily, I'm sure.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  You are under some strange mistake.  I am not little.  In fact,
"
"1","I believe I am more than usually tall for my age.  [Algernon is rather
"
"1","taken aback.]  But I am your cousin Cecily.  You, I see from your card,
"
"1","are Uncle Jack's brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily.  You mustn't
"
"1","think that I am wicked.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in
"
"1","a very inexcusable manner.  I hope you have not been leading a double
"
"1","life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time.  That
"
"1","would be hypocrisy.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Looks at her in amazement.]  Oh!  Of course I have been
"
"1","rather reckless.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I am glad to hear it.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in
"
"1","my own small way.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I don't think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure
"
"1","it must have been very pleasant.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  It is much pleasanter being here with you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I can't understand how you are here at all.  Uncle Jack won't be
"
"1","back till Monday afternoon.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  That is a great disappointment.  I am obliged to go up by the
"
"1","first train on Monday morning.  I have a business appointment that I am
"
"1","anxious . . . to miss?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Couldn't you miss it anywhere but in London?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  No: the appointment is in London.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Well, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a
"
"1","business engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of
"
"1","life, but still I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives.  I
"
"1","know he wants to speak to you about your emigrating.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  About my what?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Your emigrating.  He has gone up to buy your outfit.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I certainly wouldn't let Jack buy my outfit.  He has no taste
"
"1","in neckties at all.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I don't think you will require neckties.  Uncle Jack is sending
"
"1","you to Australia.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Australia!  I'd sooner die.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have
"
"1","to choose between this world, the next world, and Australia.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Oh, well!  The accounts I have received of Australia and the
"
"1","next world, are not particularly encouraging.  This world is good enough
"
"1","for me, cousin Cecily.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Yes, but are you good enough for it?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I'm afraid I'm not that.  That is why I want you to reform me.
"
"1","You might make that your mission, if you don't mind, cousin Cecily.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I'm afraid I've no time, this afternoon.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  It is rather Quixotic of you.  But I think you should try.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I will.  I feel better already.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  You are looking a little worse.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  That is because I am hungry.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  How thoughtless of me.  I should have remembered that when one
"
"1","is going to lead an entirely new life, one requires regular and wholesome
"
"1","meals.  Won't you come in?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Thank you.  Might I have a buttonhole first?  I never have any
"
"1","appetite unless I have a buttonhole first.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  A Marechal Niel?  [Picks up scissors.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  No, I'd sooner have a pink rose.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Why?  [Cuts a flower.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Because you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I don't think it can be right for you to talk to me like that.
"
"1","Miss Prism never says such things to me.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Then Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady.  [Cecily puts the
"
"1","rose in his buttonhole.]  You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Miss Prism says that all good looks are a snare.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  They are a snare that every sensible man would like to be
"
"1","caught in.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh, I don't think I would care to catch a sensible man.  I
"
"1","shouldn't know what to talk to him about.
"
"1","
"
"1","[They pass into the house.  Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  You are too much alone, dear Dr. Chasuble.  You should get
"
"1","married.  A misanthrope I can understand--a womanthrope, never!
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  [With a scholar's shudder.]  Believe me, I do not deserve so
"
"1","neologistic a phrase.  The precept as well as the practice of the
"
"1","Primitive Church was distinctly against matrimony.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Sententiously.]  That is obviously the reason why the
"
"1","Primitive Church has not lasted up to the present day.  And you do not
"
"1","seem to realise, dear Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a
"
"1","man converts himself into a permanent public temptation.  Men should be
"
"1","more careful; this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  But is a man not equally attractive when married?
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  No married man is ever attractive except to his wife.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  And often, I've been told, not even to her.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  That depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman.
"
"1","Maturity can always be depended on.  Ripeness can be trusted.  Young
"
"1","women are green.  [Dr. Chasuble starts.]  I spoke horticulturally.  My
"
"1","metaphor was drawn from fruits.  But where is Cecily?
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Perhaps she followed us to the schools.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Jack slowly from the back of the garden.  He is dressed in the
"
"1","deepest mourning, with crape hatband and black gloves.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Mr. Worthing!
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Mr. Worthing?
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  This is indeed a surprise.  We did not look for you till
"
"1","Monday afternoon.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Shakes Miss Prism's hand in a tragic manner.]  I have returned
"
"1","sooner than I expected.  Dr. Chasuble, I hope you are well?
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Dear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe does not betoken
"
"1","some terrible calamity?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  My brother.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  More shameful debts and extravagance?
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Still leading his life of pleasure?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Shaking his head.]  Dead!
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Your brother Ernest dead?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Quite dead.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  What a lesson for him!  I trust he will profit by it.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Mr. Worthing, I offer you my sincere condolence.  You have at
"
"1","least the consolation of knowing that you were always the most generous
"
"1","and forgiving of brothers.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Poor Ernest!  He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Very sad indeed.  Were you with him at the end?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  No.  He died abroad; in Paris, in fact.  I had a telegram last
"
"1","night from the manager of the Grand Hotel.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Was the cause of death mentioned?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  A severe chill, it seems.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  As a man sows, so shall he reap.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  [Raising his hand.]  Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity!  None
"
"1","of us are perfect.  I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts.  Will
"
"1","the interment take place here?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  No.  He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  In Paris!  [Shakes his head.]  I fear that hardly points to
"
"1","any very serious state of mind at the last.  You would no doubt wish me
"
"1","to make some slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next
"
"1","Sunday.  [Jack presses his hand convulsively.]  My sermon on the meaning
"
"1","of the manna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion,
"
"1","joyful, or, as in the present case, distressing.  [All sigh.]  I have
"
"1","preached it at harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on days
"
"1","of humiliation and festal days.  The last time I delivered it was in the
"
"1","Cathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the
"
"1","Prevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders.  The Bishop, who was
"
"1","present, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Ah! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr.
"
"1","Chasuble?  I suppose you know how to christen all right?  [Dr. Chasuble
"
"1","looks astounded.]  I mean, of course, you are continually christening,
"
"1","aren't you?
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  It is, I regret to say, one of the Rector's most constant
"
"1","duties in this parish.  I have often spoken to the poorer classes on the
"
"1","subject.  But they don't seem to know what thrift is.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  But is there any particular infant in whom you are interested,
"
"1","Mr. Worthing?  Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh yes.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Bitterly.]  People who live entirely for pleasure usually
"
"1","are.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  But it is not for any child, dear Doctor.  I am very fond of
"
"1","children.  No! the fact is, I would like to be christened myself, this
"
"1","afternoon, if you have nothing better to do.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  But surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been christened already?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I don't remember anything about it.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  But have you any grave doubts on the subject?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I certainly intend to have.  Of course I don't know if the thing
"
"1","would bother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Not at all.  The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of
"
"1","adults is a perfectly canonical practice.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Immersion!
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  You need have no apprehensions.  Sprinkling is all that is
"
"1","necessary, or indeed I think advisable.  Our weather is so changeable.  At
"
"1","what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Perfectly, perfectly!  In fact I have two similar ceremonies
"
"1","to perform at that time.  A case of twins that occurred recently in one
"
"1","of the outlying cottages on your own estate.  Poor Jenkins the carter, a
"
"1","most hard-working man.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh!  I don't see much fun in being christened along with other
"
"1","babies.  It would be childish.  Would half-past five do?
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Admirably!  Admirably!  [Takes out watch.]  And now, dear Mr.
"
"1","Worthing, I will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow.  I would
"
"1","merely beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief.  What seem to us
"
"1","bitter trials are often blessings in disguise.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  This seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Cecily from the house.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Uncle Jack!  Oh, I am pleased to see you back.  But what horrid
"
"1","clothes you have got on!  Do go and change them.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Cecily!
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  My child! my child!  [Cecily goes towards Jack; he kisses her
"
"1","brow in a melancholy manner.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  What is the matter, Uncle Jack?  Do look happy!  You look as if
"
"1","you had toothache, and I have got such a surprise for you.  Who do you
"
"1","think is in the dining-room?  Your brother!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Who?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Your brother Ernest.  He arrived about half an hour ago.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  What nonsense!  I haven't got a brother.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh, don't say that.  However badly he may have behaved to you in
"
"1","the past he is still your brother.  You couldn't be so heartless as to
"
"1","disown him.  I'll tell him to come out.  And you will shake hands with
"
"1","him, won't you, Uncle Jack?  [Runs back into the house.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  These are very joyful tidings.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  After we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden
"
"1","return seems to me peculiarly distressing.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  My brother is in the dining-room?  I don't know what it all means.
"
"1","I think it is perfectly absurd.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Algernon and Cecily hand in hand.  They come slowly up to Jack.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Good heavens!  [Motions Algernon away.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Brother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I am
"
"1","very sorry for all the trouble I have given you, and that I intend to
"
"1","lead a better life in the future.  [Jack glares at him and does not take
"
"1","his hand.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother's hand?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Nothing will induce me to take his hand.  I think his coming down
"
"1","here disgraceful.  He knows perfectly well why.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Uncle Jack, do be nice.  There is some good in every one.  Ernest
"
"1","has just been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom
"
"1","he goes to visit so often.  And surely there must be much good in one who
"
"1","is kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a bed
"
"1","of pain.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible
"
"1","state of health.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Bunbury!  Well, I won't have him talk to you about Bunbury or
"
"1","about anything else.  It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Of course I admit that the faults were all on my side.  But I
"
"1","must say that I think that Brother John's coldness to me is peculiarly
"
"1","painful.  I expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering
"
"1","it is the first time I have come here.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Uncle Jack, if you don't shake hands with Ernest I will never
"
"1","forgive you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Never forgive me?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Never, never, never!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, this is the last time I shall ever do it.  [Shakes with
"
"1","Algernon and glares.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  It's pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation?
"
"1","I think we might leave the two brothers together.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Cecily, you will come with us.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Certainly, Miss Prism.  My little task of reconciliation is
"
"1","over.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  You have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  We must not be premature in our judgments.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I feel very happy.  [They all go off except Jack and Algernon.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  You young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soon
"
"1","as possible.  I don't allow any Bunburying here.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Merriman.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  I have put Mr. Ernest's things in the room next to yours, sir.
"
"1","I suppose that is all right?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  What?
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Mr. Ernest's luggage, sir.  I have unpacked it and put it in
"
"1","the room next to your own.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  His luggage?
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Yes, sir.  Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes,
"
"1","and a large luncheon-basket.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I am afraid I can't stay more than a week this time.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Merriman, order the dog-cart at once.  Mr. Ernest has been
"
"1","suddenly called back to town.
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Yes, sir.  [Goes back into the house.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  What a fearful liar you are, Jack.  I have not been called
"
"1","back to town at all.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Yes, you have.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I haven't heard any one call me.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Your duty as a gentleman calls you back.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures
"
"1","in the smallest degree.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I can quite understand that.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, Cecily is a darling.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  You are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that.  I don't like it.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, I don't like your clothes.  You look perfectly
"
"1","ridiculous in them.  Why on earth don't you go up and change?  It is
"
"1","perfectly childish to be in deep mourning for a man who is actually
"
"1","staying for a whole week with you in your house as a guest.  I call it
"
"1","grotesque.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  You are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest
"
"1","or anything else.  You have got to leave . . . by the four-five train.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I certainly won't leave you so long as you are in mourning.  It
"
"1","would be most unfriendly.  If I were in mourning you would stay with me,
"
"1","I suppose.  I should think it very unkind if you didn't.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, will you go if I change my clothes?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes, if you are not too long.  I never saw anybody take so
"
"1","long to dress, and with such little result.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, at any rate, that is better than being always over-dressed
"
"1","as you are.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it
"
"1","by being always immensely over-educated.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Your vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an outrage, and your
"
"1","presence in my garden utterly absurd.  However, you have got to catch the
"
"1","four-five, and I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to town.  This
"
"1","Bunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Goes into the house.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I think it has been a great success.  I'm in love with Cecily,
"
"1","and that is everything.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Cecily at the back of the garden.  She picks up the can and begins
"
"1","to water the flowers.]  But I must see her before I go, and make
"
"1","arrangements for another Bunbury.  Ah, there she is.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh, I merely came back to water the roses.  I thought you were
"
"1","with Uncle Jack.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  He's gone to order the dog-cart for me.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  He's going to send me away.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Then have we got to part?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I am afraid so.  It's a very painful parting.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for
"
"1","a very brief space of time.  The absence of old friends one can endure
"
"1","with equanimity.  But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one
"
"1","has just been introduced is almost unbearable.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Thank you.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Merriman.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  The dog-cart is at the door, sir.  [Algernon looks appealingly
"
"1","at Cecily.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  It can wait, Merriman for . . . five minutes.
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  [Exit Merriman.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite
"
"1","frankly and openly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible
"
"1","personification of absolute perfection.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest.  If you
"
"1","will allow me, I will copy your remarks into my diary.  [Goes over to
"
"1","table and begins writing in diary.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Do you really keep a diary?  I'd give anything to look at it.
"
"1","May I?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh no.  [Puts her hand over it.]  You see, it is simply a very
"
"1","young girl's record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently
"
"1","meant for publication.  When it appears in volume form I hope you will
"
"1","order a copy.  But pray, Ernest, don't stop.  I delight in taking down
"
"1","from dictation.  I have reached 'absolute perfection'.  You can go on.  I
"
"1","am quite ready for more.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Somewhat taken aback.]  Ahem!  Ahem!
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh, don't cough, Ernest.  When one is dictating one should speak
"
"1","fluently and not cough.  Besides, I don't know how to spell a cough.
"
"1","[Writes as Algernon speaks.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Speaking very rapidly.]  Cecily, ever since I first looked
"
"1","upon your wonderful and incomparable beauty, I have dared to love you
"
"1","wildly, passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I don't think that you should tell me that you love me wildly,
"
"1","passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.  Hopelessly doesn't seem to make
"
"1","much sense, does it?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Cecily!
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Merriman.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  The dog-cart is waiting, sir.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Tell it to come round next week, at the same hour.
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  [Looks at Cecily, who makes no sign.]  Yes, sir.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Merriman retires.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Uncle Jack would be very much annoyed if he knew you were
"
"1","staying on till next week, at the same hour.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Oh, I don't care about Jack.  I don't care for anybody in the
"
"1","whole world but you.  I love you, Cecily.  You will marry me, won't you?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  You silly boy!  Of course.  Why, we have been engaged for the
"
"1","last three months.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  For the last three months?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Yes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  But how did we become engaged?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Well, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he
"
"1","had a younger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have
"
"1","formed the chief topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism.  And
"
"1","of course a man who is much talked about is always very attractive.  One
"
"1","feels there must be something in him, after all.  I daresay it was
"
"1","foolish of me, but I fell in love with you, Ernest.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Darling!  And when was the engagement actually settled?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  On the 14th of February last.  Worn out by your entire ignorance
"
"1","of my existence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, and
"
"1","after a long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old tree
"
"1","here.  The next day I bought this little ring in your name, and this is
"
"1","the little bangle with the true lover's knot I promised you always to
"
"1","wear.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Did I give you this?  It's very pretty, isn't it?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Yes, you've wonderfully good taste, Ernest.  It's the excuse
"
"1","I've always given for your leading such a bad life.  And this is the box
"
"1","in which I keep all your dear letters.  [Kneels at table, opens box, and
"
"1","produces letters tied up with blue ribbon.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  My letters!  But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written
"
"1","you any letters.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  You need hardly remind me of that, Ernest.  I remember only too
"
"1","well that I was forced to write your letters for you.  I wrote always
"
"1","three times a week, and sometimes oftener.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Oh, do let me read them, Cecily?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh, I couldn't possibly.  They would make you far too conceited.
"
"1","[Replaces box.]  The three you wrote me after I had broken off the
"
"1","engagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can
"
"1","hardly read them without crying a little.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  But was our engagement ever broken off?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Of course it was.  On the 22nd of last March.  You can see the
"
"1","entry if you like. [Shows diary.]  'To-day I broke off my engagement with
"
"1","Ernest.  I feel it is better to do so.  The weather still continues
"
"1","charming.'
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  But why on earth did you break it off?  What had I done?  I
"
"1","had done nothing at all.  Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you
"
"1","broke it off.  Particularly when the weather was so charming.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  It would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it
"
"1","hadn't been broken off at least once.  But I forgave you before the week
"
"1","was out.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Crossing to her, and kneeling.]  What a perfect angel you
"
"1","are, Cecily.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  You dear romantic boy.  [He kisses her, she puts her fingers
"
"1","through his hair.]  I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes, darling, with a little help from others.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I am so glad.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  You'll never break off our engagement again, Cecily?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I don't think I could break it off now that I have actually met
"
"1","you.  Besides, of course, there is the question of your name.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes, of course.  [Nervously.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a
"
"1","girlish dream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest.  [Algernon
"
"1","rises, Cecily also.]  There is something in that name that seems to
"
"1","inspire absolute confidence.  I pity any poor married woman whose husband
"
"1","is not called Ernest.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  But, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me
"
"1","if I had some other name?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  But what name?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Oh, any name you like--Algernon--for instance . . .
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  But I don't like the name of Algernon.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I really
"
"1","can't see why you should object to the name of Algernon.  It is not at
"
"1","all a bad name.  In fact, it is rather an aristocratic name.  Half of the
"
"1","chaps who get into the Bankruptcy Court are called Algernon.  But
"
"1","seriously, Cecily . . . [Moving to her] . . . if my name was Algy,
"
"1","couldn't you love me?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Rising.]  I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your
"
"1","character, but I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided
"
"1","attention.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Ahem!  Cecily!  [Picking up hat.]  Your Rector here is, I
"
"1","suppose, thoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites and
"
"1","ceremonials of the Church?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh, yes.  Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man.  He has never
"
"1","written a single book, so you can imagine how much he knows.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I must see him at once on a most important christening--I mean
"
"1","on most important business.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I shan't be away more than half an hour.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Considering that we have been engaged since February the 14th,
"
"1","and that I only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is rather
"
"1","hard that you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour.
"
"1","Couldn't you make it twenty minutes?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I'll be back in no time.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Kisses her and rushes down the garden.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  What an impetuous boy he is!  I like his hair so much.  I must
"
"1","enter his proposal in my diary.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Merriman.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  A Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr. Worthing.  On very
"
"1","important business, Miss Fairfax states.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Isn't Mr. Worthing in his library?
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Mr. Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory some
"
"1","time ago.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Pray ask the lady to come out here; Mr. Worthing is sure to be
"
"1","back soon.  And you can bring tea.
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  [Goes out.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Miss Fairfax!  I suppose one of the many good elderly women who
"
"1","are associated with Uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work in
"
"1","London.  I don't quite like women who are interested in philanthropic
"
"1","work.  I think it is so forward of them.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Merriman.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Miss Fairfax.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Gwendolen.]
"
"1","
"
"1","[Exit Merriman.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Advancing to meet her.]  Pray let me introduce myself to you.
"
"1","My name is Cecily Cardew.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Cecily Cardew?  [Moving to her and shaking hands.]  What a
"
"1","very sweet name!  Something tells me that we are going to be great
"
"1","friends.  I like you already more than I can say.  My first impressions
"
"1","of people are never wrong.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  How nice of you to like me so much after we have known each
"
"1","other such a comparatively short time.  Pray sit down.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Still standing up.]  I may call you Cecily, may I not?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  With pleasure!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  And you will always call me Gwendolen, won't you?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  If you wish.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Then that is all quite settled, is it not?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I hope so.  [A pause.  They both sit down together.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my
"
"1","mentioning who I am.  My father is Lord Bracknell.  You have never heard
"
"1","of papa, I suppose?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I don't think so.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is
"
"1","entirely unknown.  I think that is quite as it should be.  The home seems
"
"1","to me to be the proper sphere for the man.  And certainly once a man
"
"1","begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate,
"
"1","does he not?  And I don't like that.  It makes men so very attractive.
"
"1","Cecily, mamma, whose views on education are remarkably strict, has
"
"1","brought me up to be extremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so
"
"1","do you mind my looking at you through my glasses?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh! not at all, Gwendolen.  I am very fond of being looked at.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette.]  You
"
"1","are here on a short visit, I suppose.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh no!  I live here.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Severely.]  Really?  Your mother, no doubt, or some female
"
"1","relative of advanced years, resides here also?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh no!  I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Indeed?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  My dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has the
"
"1","arduous task of looking after me.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Your guardian?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Yes, I am Mr. Worthing's ward.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Oh!  It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a
"
"1","ward.  How secretive of him!  He grows more interesting hourly.  I am not
"
"1","sure, however, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed
"
"1","delight.  [Rising and going to her.]  I am very fond of you, Cecily; I
"
"1","have liked you ever since I met you!  But I am bound to state that now
"
"1","that I know that you are Mr. Worthing's ward, I cannot help expressing a
"
"1","wish you were--well, just a little older than you seem to be--and not
"
"1","quite so very alluring in appearance.  In fact, if I may speak candidly--
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Pray do!  I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to
"
"1","say, one should always be quite candid.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you
"
"1","were fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age.  Ernest
"
"1","has a strong upright nature.  He is the very soul of truth and honour.
"
"1","Disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception.  But even men of
"
"1","the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the
"
"1","influence of the physical charms of others.  Modern, no less than Ancient
"
"1","History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I refer to.
"
"1","If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Yes.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian.  It is
"
"1","his brother--his elder brother.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Sitting down again.]  Ernest never mentioned to me that he
"
"1","had a brother.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long
"
"1","time.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Ah! that accounts for it.  And now that I think of it I have
"
"1","never heard any man mention his brother.  The subject seems distasteful
"
"1","to most men.  Cecily, you have lifted a load from my mind.  I was growing
"
"1","almost anxious.  It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across
"
"1","a friendship like ours, would it not?  Of course you are quite, quite
"
"1","sure that it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Quite sure.  [A pause.]  In fact, I am going to be his.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Inquiringly.]  I beg your pardon?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Rather shy and confidingly.]  Dearest Gwendolen, there is no
"
"1","reason why I should make a secret of it to you.  Our little county
"
"1","newspaper is sure to chronicle the fact next week.  Mr. Ernest Worthing
"
"1","and I are engaged to be married.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Quite politely, rising.]  My darling Cecily, I think there
"
"1","must be some slight error.  Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.  The
"
"1","announcement will appear in the _Morning Post_ on Saturday at the latest.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Very politely, rising.]  I am afraid you must be under some
"
"1","misconception.  Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago.  [Shows
"
"1","diary.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.]  It is
"
"1","certainly very curious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday
"
"1","afternoon at 5.30.  If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so.
"
"1","[Produces diary of her own.]  I never travel without my diary.  One
"
"1","should always have something sensational to read in the train.  I am so
"
"1","sorry, dear Cecily, if it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I
"
"1","have the prior claim.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  It would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen,
"
"1","if it caused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to
"
"1","point out that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his
"
"1","mind.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Meditatively.]  If the poor fellow has been entrapped into
"
"1","any foolish promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once,
"
"1","and with a firm hand.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Thoughtfully and sadly.]  Whatever unfortunate entanglement my
"
"1","dear boy may have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we
"
"1","are married.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement?  You
"
"1","are presumptuous.  On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a
"
"1","moral duty to speak one's mind.  It becomes a pleasure.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an
"
"1","engagement?  How dare you?  This is no time for wearing the shallow mask
"
"1","of manners.  When I see a spade I call it a spade.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Satirically.]  I am glad to say that I have never seen a
"
"1","spade.  It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Merriman, followed by the footman.  He carries a salver, table
"
"1","cloth, and plate stand.  Cecily is about to retort.  The presence of the
"
"1","servants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls
"
"1","chafe.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Shall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Sternly, in a calm voice.]  Yes, as usual.  [Merriman begins to
"
"1","clear table and lay cloth.  A long pause.  Cecily and Gwendolen glare at
"
"1","each other.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Are there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss
"
"1","Cardew?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh! yes! a great many.  From the top of one of the hills quite
"
"1","close one can see five counties.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Five counties!  I don't think I should like that; I hate
"
"1","crowds.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Sweetly.]  I suppose that is why you live in town?  [Gwendolen
"
"1","bites her lip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Looking round.]  Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss
"
"1","Cardew.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  So glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in
"
"1","London.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Personally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist
"
"1","in the country, if anybody who is anybody does.  The country always bores
"
"1","me to death.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Ah!  This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression,
"
"1","is it not?  I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from it
"
"1","just at present.  It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been
"
"1","told.  May I offer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [With elaborate politeness.]  Thank you.  [Aside.]  Detestable
"
"1","girl!  But I require tea!
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Sweetly.]  Sugar?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Superciliously.]  No, thank you.  Sugar is not fashionable
"
"1","any more. [Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four
"
"1","lumps of sugar into the cup.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Severely.]  Cake or bread and butter?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [In a bored manner.]  Bread and butter, please.  Cake is
"
"1","rarely seen at the best houses nowadays.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.]  Hand
"
"1","that to Miss Fairfax.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Merriman does so, and goes out with footman.  Gwendolen drinks the tea
"
"1","and makes a grimace.  Puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to the
"
"1","bread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake.  Rises in
"
"1","indignation.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I
"
"1","asked most distinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake.  I am
"
"1","known for the gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary
"
"1","sweetness of my nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Rising.]  To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the
"
"1","machinations of any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not
"
"1","go.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  From the moment I saw you I distrusted you.  I felt that you
"
"1","were false and deceitful.  I am never deceived in such matters.  My first
"
"1","impressions of people are invariably right.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your
"
"1","valuable time.  No doubt you have many other calls of a similar character
"
"1","to make in the neighbourhood.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Jack.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Catching sight of him.]  Ernest!  My own Ernest!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Gwendolen!  Darling!  [Offers to kiss her.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Draws back.]  A moment!  May I ask if you are engaged to be
"
"1","married to this young lady?  [Points to Cecily.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Laughing.]  To dear little Cecily!  Of course not!  What could
"
"1","have put such an idea into your pretty little head?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Thank you.  You may!  [Offers her cheek.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Very sweetly.]  I knew there must be some misunderstanding,
"
"1","Miss Fairfax.  The gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist is
"
"1","my guardian, Mr. John Worthing.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I beg your pardon?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  This is Uncle Jack.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Receding.]  Jack!  Oh!
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Algernon.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Here is Ernest.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Goes straight over to Cecily without noticing any one else.]
"
"1","My own love!  [Offers to kiss her.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Drawing back.]  A moment, Ernest!  May I ask you--are you
"
"1","engaged to be married to this young lady?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Looking round.]  To what young lady?  Good heavens!
"
"1","Gwendolen!
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Yes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean to Gwendolen.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Laughing.]  Of course not!  What could have put such an idea
"
"1","into your pretty little head?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Thank you.  [Presenting her cheek to be kissed.]  You may.
"
"1","[Algernon kisses her.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew.  The
"
"1","gentleman who is now embracing you is my cousin, Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Breaking away from Algernon.]  Algernon Moncrieff!  Oh!  [The
"
"1","two girls move towards each other and put their arms round each other's
"
"1","waists as if for protection.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Are you called Algernon?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I cannot deny it.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Oh!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Is your name really John?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Standing rather proudly.]  I could deny it if I liked.  I could
"
"1","deny anything if I liked.  But my name certainly is John.  It has been
"
"1","John for years.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [To Gwendolen.]  A gross deception has been practised on both of
"
"1","us.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  My poor wounded Cecily!
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  My sweet wronged Gwendolen!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Slowly and seriously.]  You will call me sister, will you
"
"1","not?  [They embrace.  Jack and Algernon groan and walk up and down.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Rather brightly.]  There is just one question I would like to
"
"1","be allowed to ask my guardian.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  An admirable idea!  Mr. Worthing, there is just one question
"
"1","I would like to be permitted to put to you.  Where is your brother
"
"1","Ernest?  We are both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it
"
"1","is a matter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is
"
"1","at present.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Slowly and hesitatingly.]  Gwendolen--Cecily--it is very painful
"
"1","for me to be forced to speak the truth.  It is the first time in my life
"
"1","that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really
"
"1","quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.  However, I will tell
"
"1","you quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest.  I have no brother at
"
"1","all.  I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the
"
"1","smallest intention of ever having one in the future.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Surprised.]  No brother at all?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Cheerily.]  None!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [Severely.]  Had you never a brother of any kind?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Pleasantly.]  Never.  Not even of any kind.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us is
"
"1","engaged to be married to any one.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  It is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to
"
"1","find herself in.  Is it?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Let us go into the house.  They will hardly venture to come
"
"1","after us there.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  No, men are so cowardly, aren't they?
"
"1","
"
"1","[They retire into the house with scornful looks.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  This ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, I
"
"1","suppose?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is.  The most
"
"1","wonderful Bunbury I have ever had in my life.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, you've no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  That is absurd.  One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one
"
"1","chooses.  Every serious Bunburyist knows that.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Serious Bunburyist!  Good heavens!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, one must be serious about something, if one wants to
"
"1","have any amusement in life.  I happen to be serious about Bunburying.
"
"1","What on earth you are serious about I haven't got the remotest idea.
"
"1","About everything, I should fancy.  You have such an absolutely trivial
"
"1","nature.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this
"
"1","wretched business is that your friend Bunbury is quite exploded.  You
"
"1","won't be able to run down to the country quite so often as you used to
"
"1","do, dear Algy.  And a very good thing too.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Your brother is a little off colour, isn't he, dear Jack?  You
"
"1","won't be able to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked
"
"1","custom was.  And not a bad thing either.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  As for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that your
"
"1","taking in a sweet, simple, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable.
"
"1","To say nothing of the fact that she is my ward.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a
"
"1","brilliant, clever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax.
"
"1","To say nothing of the fact that she is my cousin.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all.  I love her.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily.  I adore her.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  There is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I don't think there is much likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss
"
"1","Fairfax being united.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Well, that is no business of yours.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  If it was my business, I wouldn't talk about it.  [Begins to
"
"1","eat muffins.]  It is very vulgar to talk about one's business.  Only
"
"1","people like stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  How can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this
"
"1","horrible trouble, I can't make out.  You seem to me to be perfectly
"
"1","heartless.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, I can't eat muffins in an agitated manner.  The butter
"
"1","would probably get on my cuffs.  One should always eat muffins quite
"
"1","calmly.  It is the only way to eat them.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I say it's perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under
"
"1","the circumstances.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles
"
"1","me.  Indeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me
"
"1","intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink.  At
"
"1","the present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy.  Besides, I
"
"1","am particularly fond of muffins.  [Rising.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Rising.]  Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in
"
"1","that greedy way. [Takes muffins from Algernon.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Offering tea-cake.]  I wish you would have tea-cake instead.
"
"1","I don't like tea-cake.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Good heavens!  I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own
"
"1","garden.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  But you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat
"
"1","muffins.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances.
"
"1","That is a very different thing.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  That may be.  But the muffins are the same.  [He seizes the
"
"1","muffin-dish from Jack.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Algy, I wish to goodness you would go.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  You can't possibly ask me to go without having some dinner.
"
"1","It's absurd.  I never go without my dinner.  No one ever does, except
"
"1","vegetarians and people like that.  Besides I have just made arrangements
"
"1","with Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name of
"
"1","Ernest.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  My dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better.  I
"
"1","made arrangements this morning with Dr. Chasuble to be christened myself
"
"1","at 5.30, and I naturally will take the name of Ernest.  Gwendolen would
"
"1","wish it.  We can't both be christened Ernest.  It's absurd.  Besides, I
"
"1","have a perfect right to be christened if I like.  There is no evidence at
"
"1","all that I have ever been christened by anybody.  I should think it
"
"1","extremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble.  It is entirely
"
"1","different in your case.  You have been christened already.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes, but I have not been christened for years.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Yes, but you have been christened.  That is the important thing.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Quite so.  So I know my constitution can stand it.  If you are
"
"1","not quite sure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think
"
"1","it rather dangerous your venturing on it now.  It might make you very
"
"1","unwell.  You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closely
"
"1","connected with you was very nearly carried off this week in Paris by a
"
"1","severe chill.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Yes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  It usen't to be, I know--but I daresay it is now.  Science is
"
"1","always making wonderful improvements in things.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Picking up the muffin-dish.]  Oh, that is nonsense; you are
"
"1","always talking nonsense.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Jack, you are at the muffins again!  I wish you wouldn't.
"
"1","There are only two left.  [Takes them.]  I told you I was particularly
"
"1","fond of muffins.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  But I hate tea-cake.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Why on earth then do you allow tea-cake to be served up for
"
"1","your guests?  What ideas you have of hospitality!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Algernon!  I have already told you to go.  I don't want you here.
"
"1","Why don't you go!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I haven't quite finished my tea yet! and there is still one
"
"1","muffin left.  [Jack groans, and sinks into a chair.  Algernon still
"
"1","continues eating.]

"
"1","
"
"1","THIRD ACT
"
"1","
"
"1","
"
"1","SCENE
"
"1","
"
"1","
"
"1","Morning-room at the Manor House.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house,
"
"1","as any one else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some
"
"1","sense of shame left.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  They have been eating muffins.  That looks like repentance.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [After a pause.]  They don't seem to notice us at all.
"
"1","Couldn't you cough?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  But I haven't got a cough.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  They're looking at us.  What effrontery!
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  They're approaching.  That's very forward of them.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Let us preserve a dignified silence.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Certainly.  It's the only thing to do now.  [Enter Jack followed
"
"1","by Algernon.  They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British
"
"1","Opera.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  A most distasteful one.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  But we will not be the first to speak.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Certainly not.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you.
"
"1","Much depends on your reply.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable.  Mr. Moncrieff,
"
"1","kindly answer me the following question.  Why did you pretend to be my
"
"1","guardian's brother?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [To Gwendolen.]  That certainly seems a satisfactory
"
"1","explanation, does it not?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Yes, dear, if you can believe him.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I don't.  But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his
"
"1","answer.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  True.  In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity
"
"1","is the vital thing.  Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me
"
"1","for pretending to have a brother?  Was it in order that you might have an
"
"1","opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I have the gravest doubts upon the subject.  But I intend to
"
"1","crush them.  This is not the moment for German scepticism.  [Moving to
"
"1","Cecily.]  Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially
"
"1","Mr. Worthing's.  That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.  His voice
"
"1","alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Then you think we should forgive them?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Yes.  I mean no.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  True!  I had forgotten.  There are principles at stake that
"
"1","one cannot surrender.  Which of us should tell them?  The task is not a
"
"1","pleasant one.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Could we not both speak at the same time?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  An excellent idea!  I nearly always speak at the same time as
"
"1","other people.  Will you take the time from me?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Certainly.  [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen and Cecily [Speaking together.]  Your Christian names are still
"
"1","an insuperable barrier.  That is all!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack and Algernon [Speaking together.]  Our Christian names!  Is that
"
"1","all?  But we are going to be christened this afternoon.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [To Jack.]  For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible
"
"1","thing?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I am.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [To Algernon.]  To please me you are ready to face this fearful
"
"1","ordeal?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I am!
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!  Where
"
"1","questions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  We are.  [Clasps hands with Algernon.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  They have moments of physical courage of which we women know
"
"1","absolutely nothing.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [To Jack.]  Darling!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [To Cecily.]  Darling!  [They fall into each other's arms.]
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Merriman.  When he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the situation.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Merriman.  Ahem!  Ahem!  Lady Bracknell!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Good heavens!
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Lady Bracknell.  The couples separate in alarm.  Exit Merriman.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Gwendolen!  What does this mean?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing,
"
"1","mamma.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Come here.  Sit down.  Sit down immediately.  Hesitation
"
"1","of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness
"
"1","in the old.  [Turns to Jack.]  Apprised, sir, of my daughter's sudden
"
"1","flight by her trusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a
"
"1","small coin, I followed her at once by a luggage train.  Her unhappy
"
"1","father is, I am glad to say, under the impression that she is attending a
"
"1","more than usually lengthy lecture by the University Extension Scheme on
"
"1","the Influence of a permanent income on Thought.  I do not propose to
"
"1","undeceive him.  Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question.  I
"
"1","would consider it wrong.  But of course, you will clearly understand that
"
"1","all communication between yourself and my daughter must cease immediately
"
"1","from this moment.  On this point, as indeed on all points, I am firm.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell!
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  You are nothing of the kind, sir.  And now, as regards
"
"1","Algernon! . . . Algernon!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes, Aunt Augusta.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  May I ask if it is in this house that your invalid
"
"1","friend Mr. Bunbury resides?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Stammering.]  Oh!  No!  Bunbury doesn't live here.  Bunbury
"
"1","is somewhere else at present.  In fact, Bunbury is dead.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Dead!  When did Mr. Bunbury die?  His death must have
"
"1","been extremely sudden.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  [Airily.]  Oh!  I killed Bunbury this afternoon.  I mean poor
"
"1","Bunbury died this afternoon.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  What did he die of?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Bunbury?  Oh, he was quite exploded.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Exploded!  Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage?
"
"1","I was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation.  If
"
"1","so, he is well punished for his morbidity.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out!  The doctors
"
"1","found out that Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean--so Bunbury
"
"1","died.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of
"
"1","his physicians.  I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last
"
"1","to some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice.
"
"1","And now that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr.
"
"1","Worthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now
"
"1","holding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.  [Lady Bracknell bows
"
"1","coldly to Cecily.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  I am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  I beg your pardon?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.]
"
"1","I do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of
"
"1","this particular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that
"
"1","go on seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics
"
"1","have laid down for our guidance.  I think some preliminary inquiry on my
"
"1","part would not be out of place.  Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all
"
"1","connected with any of the larger railway stations in London?  I merely
"
"1","desire information.  Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any
"
"1","families or persons whose origin was a Terminus.  [Jack looks perfectly
"
"1","furious, but restrains himself.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [In a clear, cold voice.]  Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of
"
"1","the late Mr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park,
"
"1","Dorking, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  That sounds not unsatisfactory.  Three addresses always
"
"1","inspire confidence, even in tradesmen.  But what proof have I of their
"
"1","authenticity?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period.  They
"
"1","are open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Grimly.]  I have known strange errors in that
"
"1","publication.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Miss Cardew's family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and
"
"1","Markby.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Markby, Markby, and Markby?  A firm of the very highest
"
"1","position in their profession.  Indeed I am told that one of the Mr.
"
"1","Markby's is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties.  So far I am
"
"1","satisfied.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Very irritably.]  How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell!  I
"
"1","have also in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of
"
"1","Miss Cardew's birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration, vaccination,
"
"1","confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the English variety.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps
"
"1","somewhat too exciting for a young girl.  I am not myself in favour of
"
"1","premature experiences.  [Rises, looks at her watch.]  Gwendolen! the time
"
"1","approaches for our departure.  We have not a moment to lose.  As a matter
"
"1","of form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little
"
"1","fortune?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds.  That
"
"1","is all.  Goodbye, Lady Bracknell.  So pleased to have seen you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Sitting down again.]  A moment, Mr. Worthing.  A
"
"1","hundred and thirty thousand pounds!  And in the Funds!  Miss Cardew seems
"
"1","to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.  Few girls of
"
"1","the present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities
"
"1","that last, and improve with time.  We live, I regret to say, in an age of
"
"1","surfaces.  [To Cecily.]  Come over here, dear.  [Cecily goes across.]
"
"1","Pretty child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as
"
"1","Nature might have left it.  But we can soon alter all that.  A thoroughly
"
"1","experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very
"
"1","brief space of time.  I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing,
"
"1","and after three months her own husband did not know her.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  And after six months nobody knew her.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Glares at Jack for a few moments.  Then bends, with a
"
"1","practised smile, to Cecily.]  Kindly turn round, sweet child.  [Cecily
"
"1","turns completely round.]  No, the side view is what I want.  [Cecily
"
"1","presents her profile.]  Yes, quite as I expected.  There are distinct
"
"1","social possibilities in your profile.  The two weak points in our age are
"
"1","its want of principle and its want of profile.  The chin a little higher,
"
"1","dear.  Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn.  They are worn
"
"1","very high, just at present.  Algernon!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Yes, Aunt Augusta!
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew's
"
"1","profile.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole
"
"1","world.  And I don't care twopence about social possibilities.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.  Only
"
"1","people who can't get into it do that.  [To Cecily.]  Dear child, of
"
"1","course you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon.
"
"1","But I do not approve of mercenary marriages.  When I married Lord
"
"1","Bracknell I had no fortune of any kind.  But I never dreamed for a moment
"
"1","of allowing that to stand in my way.  Well, I suppose I must give my
"
"1","consent.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Cecily, you may kiss me!
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  [Kisses her.]  Thank you, Lady Bracknell.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long
"
"1","engagements.  They give people the opportunity of finding out each
"
"1","other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this
"
"1","engagement is quite out of the question.  I am Miss Cardew's guardian,
"
"1","and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age.  That
"
"1","consent I absolutely decline to give.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Upon what grounds may I ask?  Algernon is an extremely,
"
"1","I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man.  He has nothing,
"
"1","but he looks everything.  What more can one desire?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady
"
"1","Bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at
"
"1","all of his moral character.  I suspect him of being untruthful.  [Algernon
"
"1","and Cecily look at him in indignant amazement.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Untruthful!  My nephew Algernon?  Impossible!  He is an
"
"1","Oxonian.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.  This
"
"1","afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question
"
"1","of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false
"
"1","pretence of being my brother.  Under an assumed name he drank, I've just
"
"1","been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet,
"
"1","Brut, '89; wine I was specially reserving for myself.  Continuing his
"
"1","disgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in
"
"1","alienating the affections of my only ward.  He subsequently stayed to
"
"1","tea, and devoured every single muffin.  And what makes his conduct all
"
"1","the more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first
"
"1","that I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don't
"
"1","intend to have a brother, not even of any kind.  I distinctly told him so
"
"1","myself yesterday afternoon.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have
"
"1","decided entirely to overlook my nephew's conduct to you.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell.  My own decision,
"
"1","however, is unalterable.  I decline to give my consent.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [To Cecily.]  Come here, sweet child.  [Cecily goes
"
"1","over.]  How old are you, dear?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty
"
"1","when I go to evening parties.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  You are perfectly right in making some slight
"
"1","alteration.  Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her
"
"1","age.  It looks so calculating . . . [In a meditative manner.]  Eighteen,
"
"1","but admitting to twenty at evening parties.  Well, it will not be very
"
"1","long before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.  So
"
"1","I don't think your guardian's consent is, after all, a matter of any
"
"1","importance.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it
"
"1","is only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather's
"
"1","will Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.  Thirty-
"
"1","five is a very attractive age.  London society is full of women of the
"
"1","very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-
"
"1","five for years.  Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.  To my own
"
"1","knowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of
"
"1","forty, which was many years ago now.  I see no reason why our dear Cecily
"
"1","should not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than she
"
"1","is at present.  There will be a large accumulation of property.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Of course I could, Cecily.  You know I could.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn't wait all that time.
"
"1","I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody.  It always makes me rather
"
"1","cross.  I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in
"
"1","others, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Then what is to be done, Cecily?
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  I don't know, Mr. Moncrieff.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively
"
"1","that she cannot wait till she is thirty-five--a remark which I am bound
"
"1","to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature--I would beg of
"
"1","you to reconsider your decision.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own
"
"1","hands.  The moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most
"
"1","gladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Rising and drawing herself up.]  You must be quite
"
"1","aware that what you propose is out of the question.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward
"
"1","to.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.
"
"1","Algernon, of course, can choose for himself.  [Pulls out her watch.]
"
"1","Come, dear, [Gwendolen rises] we have already missed five, if not six,
"
"1","trains.  To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Dr. Chasuble.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Everything is quite ready for the christenings.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  The christenings, sir!  Is not that somewhat premature?
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  [Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.]
"
"1","Both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  At their age?  The idea is grotesque and irreligious!
"
"1","Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized.  I will not hear of such excesses.
"
"1","Lord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was the
"
"1","way in which you wasted your time and money.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings
"
"1","at all this afternoon?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I don't think that, as things are now, it would be of much
"
"1","practical value to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing.
"
"1","They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have
"
"1","completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.  However, as your
"
"1","present mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the
"
"1","church at once.  Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that
"
"1","for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the
"
"1","vestry.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Starting.]  Miss Prism!  Did I hear you mention a Miss
"
"1","Prism?
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I am on my way to join her.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Pray allow me to detain you for a moment.  This matter
"
"1","may prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself.  Is
"
"1","this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with
"
"1","education?
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  [Somewhat indignantly.]  She is the most cultivated of ladies,
"
"1","and the very picture of respectability.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  It is obviously the same person.  May I ask what
"
"1","position she holds in your household?
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  [Severely.]  I am a celibate, madam.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Interposing.]  Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last
"
"1","three years Miss Cardew's esteemed governess and valued companion.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once.
"
"1","Let her be sent for.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  [Looking off.]  She approaches; she is nigh.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon.  I
"
"1","have been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.  [Catches
"
"1","sight of Lady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare.  Miss
"
"1","Prism grows pale and quails.  She looks anxiously round as if desirous to
"
"1","escape.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [In a severe, judicial voice.]  Prism!  [Miss Prism bows
"
"1","her head in shame.]  Come here, Prism!  [Miss Prism approaches in a
"
"1","humble manner.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [General consternation.  The
"
"1","Canon starts back in horror.  Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to
"
"1","shield Cecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public
"
"1","scandal.]  Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell's
"
"1","house, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator
"
"1","that contained a baby of the male sex.  You never returned.  A few weeks
"
"1","later, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police,
"
"1","the perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a
"
"1","remote corner of Bayswater.  It contained the manuscript of a
"
"1","three-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality.  [Miss
"
"1","Prism starts in involuntary indignation.]  But the baby was not there!
"
"1","[Every one looks at Miss Prism.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [A pause.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know.  I
"
"1","only wish I did.  The plain facts of the case are these.  On the morning
"
"1","of the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I
"
"1","prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.  I had also
"
"1","with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to
"
"1","place the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my
"
"1","few unoccupied hours.  In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I
"
"1","never can forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette,
"
"1","and placed the baby in the hand-bag.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Who has been listening attentively.]  But where did you deposit
"
"1","the hand-bag?
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me.  I
"
"1","insist on knowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that
"
"1","infant.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway
"
"1","stations in London.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  What railway station?
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Quite crushed.]  Victoria.  The Brighton line.  [Sinks into
"
"1","a chair.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  I must retire to my room for a moment.  Gwendolen, wait here for
"
"1","me.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my
"
"1","life.  [Exit Jack in great excitement.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  What do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  I dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble.  I need hardly
"
"1","tell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are not
"
"1","supposed to occur.  They are hardly considered the thing.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about.  Every
"
"1","one looks up.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  Your guardian has a very emotional nature.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  This noise is extremely unpleasant.  It sounds as if he
"
"1","was having an argument.  I dislike arguments of any kind.  They are
"
"1","always vulgar, and often convincing.
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  [Looking up.]  It has stopped now.  [The noise is redoubled.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  I wish he would arrive at some conclusion.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  This suspense is terrible.  I hope it will last.  [Enter Jack
"
"1","with a hand-bag of black leather in his hand.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Rushing over to Miss Prism.]  Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism?
"
"1","Examine it carefully before you speak.  The happiness of more than one
"
"1","life depends on your answer.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Calmly.]  It seems to be mine.  Yes, here is the injury it
"
"1","received through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and
"
"1","happier days.  Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of
"
"1","a temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington.  And
"
"1","here, on the lock, are my initials.  I had forgotten that in an
"
"1","extravagant mood I had had them placed there.  The bag is undoubtedly
"
"1","mine.  I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.  It has
"
"1","been a great inconvenience being without it all these years.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [In a pathetic voice.]  Miss Prism, more is restored to you than
"
"1","this hand-bag.  I was the baby you placed in it.
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Amazed.]  You?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Embracing her.]  Yes . . . mother!
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Recoiling in indignant astonishment.]  Mr. Worthing!  I am
"
"1","unmarried!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Unmarried!  I do not deny that is a serious blow.  But after all,
"
"1","who has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered?  Cannot
"
"1","repentance wipe out an act of folly?  Why should there be one law for
"
"1","men, and another for women?  Mother, I forgive you.  [Tries to embrace
"
"1","her again.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Still more indignant.]  Mr. Worthing, there is some error.
"
"1","[Pointing to Lady Bracknell.]  There is the lady who can tell you who you
"
"1","really are.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [After a pause.]  Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but
"
"1","would you kindly inform me who I am?
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  I am afraid that the news I have to give you will not
"
"1","altogether please you.  You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs.
"
"1","Moncrieff, and consequently Algernon's elder brother.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Algy's elder brother!  Then I have a brother after all.  I knew I
"
"1","had a brother!  I always said I had a brother!  Cecily,--how could you
"
"1","have ever doubted that I had a brother?  [Seizes hold of Algernon.]  Dr.
"
"1","Chasuble, my unfortunate brother.  Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.
"
"1","Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother.  Algy, you young scoundrel, you will
"
"1","have to treat me with more respect in the future.  You have never behaved
"
"1","to me like a brother in all your life.
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.  I did my best,
"
"1","however, though I was out of practice.
"
"1","
"
"1","[Shakes hands.]
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  [To Jack.]  My own!  But what own are you?  What is your
"
"1","Christian name, now that you have become some one else?
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Good heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point.  Your
"
"1","decision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I never change, except in my affections.
"
"1","
"
"1","Cecily.  What a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Then the question had better be cleared up at once.  Aunt Augusta,
"
"1","a moment.  At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I
"
"1","been christened already?
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Every luxury that money could buy, including
"
"1","christening, had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Then I was christened!  That is settled.  Now, what name was I
"
"1","given?  Let me know the worst.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Being the eldest son you were naturally christened after
"
"1","your father.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  [Irritably.]  Yes, but what was my father's Christian name?
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  [Meditatively.]  I cannot at the present moment recall
"
"1","what the General's Christian name was.  But I have no doubt he had one.
"
"1","He was eccentric, I admit.  But only in later years.  And that was the
"
"1","result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other
"
"1","things of that kind.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Algy!  Can't you recollect what our father's Christian name was?
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  My dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms.  He died
"
"1","before I was a year old.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  His name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose,
"
"1","Aunt Augusta?
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  The General was essentially a man of peace, except in
"
"1","his domestic life.  But I have no doubt his name would appear in any
"
"1","military directory.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  The Army Lists of the last forty years are here.  These delightful
"
"1","records should have been my constant study.  [Rushes to bookcase and
"
"1","tears the books out.]  M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what
"
"1","ghastly names they have--Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!  Lieutenant
"
"1","1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christian
"
"1","names, Ernest John.  [Puts book very quietly down and speaks quite
"
"1","calmly.]  I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn't I?
"
"1","Well, it is Ernest after all.  I mean it naturally is Ernest.
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  Yes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest,
"
"1","I knew I had some particular reason for disliking the name.
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  Ernest!  My own Ernest!  I felt from the first that you could
"
"1","have no other name!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly
"
"1","that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.  Can you
"
"1","forgive me?
"
"1","
"
"1","Gwendolen.  I can.  For I feel that you are sure to change.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  My own one!
"
"1","
"
"1","Chasuble.  [To Miss Prism.]  Laetitia!  [Embraces her]
"
"1","
"
"1","Miss Prism.  [Enthusiastically.]  Frederick!  At last!
"
"1","
"
"1","Algernon.  Cecily!  [Embraces her.]  At last!
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  Gwendolen!  [Embraces her.]  At last!
"
"1","
"
"1","Lady Bracknell.  My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of
"
"1","triviality.
"
"1","
"
"1","Jack.  On the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I've now realised for the first
"
"1","time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.
