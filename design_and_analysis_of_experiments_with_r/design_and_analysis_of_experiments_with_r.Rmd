# 5. Designs to Study Variances

## 5.1 Introduction 

This is another purpose of experimentation to study sources of variability in the response. 

Three reasons to study the sources of variability: 

* descriptive, and the variance components have values in themselves

* quantifying the sources of variability to gain insight how to reduce the variance

* stimulating ideas about the cuases of variability that could be tested in further experiments
